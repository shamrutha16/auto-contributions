  Learning Objective:
  This tutorial will teach you how to create a dynamic progress bar using CSS animations.
  We will focus on using CSS keyframes to animate the width of an element,
  visually representing data loading or task completion.
  This is a fundamental technique for enhancing user experience by providing
  visual feedback on ongoing processes.
*/

/*
  1. The Container Element
  This div acts as the outer shell of our progress bar.
  It provides the boundaries and background for the progress bar itself.
*/
.progress-bar-container {
  width: 80%; /* Sets the overall width of the progress bar to 80% of its parent.
                  This makes it responsive. */
  height: 30px; /* Defines the height of the progress bar. */
  background-color: #e0e0e0; /* A light grey background for the container.
                               This is what the user sees when the progress is 0%. */
  border-radius: 5px; /* Rounds the corners of the container for a softer look. */
  overflow: hidden; /* Crucial! This ensures that the inner progress bar
                       doesn't spill out of its container as it grows. */
  margin: 20px auto; /* Centers the progress bar horizontally on the page.
                        '20px' adds some vertical spacing. */
  box-shadow: inset 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Adds a subtle inner shadow to give depth. */
}

/*
  2. The Inner Progress Bar Element
  This is the element that will grow to represent the progress.
  We'll animate its width.
*/
.progress-bar {
  height: 100%; /* Makes the inner bar fill the entire height of its container. */
  width: 0%; /* Starts at 0% width, meaning no progress initially.
                This is the starting point for our animation. */
  background-color: #4CAF50; /* A vibrant green color for the progress bar.
                                 You can change this to any color you like. */
  border-radius: 5px; /* Rounds the corners to match the container. */

  /*
    3. The Animation Definition
    'progress-animation' is the name of our custom animation.
    We'll define what happens during this animation using @keyframes.
  */
  animation-name: progress-animation;

  /*
    4. Animation Duration
    '5s' means the animation will take 5 seconds to complete one full cycle.
    Adjust this to control how fast the progress bar fills.
  */
  animation-duration: 5s;

  /*
    5. Animation Timing Function
    'ease-in-out' makes the animation start slowly, speed up in the middle,
    and then slow down again at the end. This creates a more natural feel.
    Other options include 'linear', 'ease', 'ease-in', 'ease-out'.
  */
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;

  /*
    6. Animation Iteration Count
    '1' means the animation will play only once.
    'infinite' would make it loop forever (useful for loading spinners, but not typical progress bars).
  */
  animation-iteration-count: 1;

  /*
    7. Animation Fill Mode
    'forwards' is important here! It tells the animation to retain
    the styles from its last keyframe after the animation finishes.
    Without 'forwards', the progress bar would reset to 0% width after completion.
  */
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

/*
  8. The Keyframes
  This rule defines the stages of our animation over its duration.
  '0%' is the start of the animation, and '100%' is the end.
*/
@keyframes progress-animation {
  0% {
    width: 0%; /* At the very beginning (0% of the animation duration),
                  the progress bar has 0% width. */
  }
  100% {
    width: 100%; /* At the very end (100% of the animation duration),
                   the progress bar has reached 100% width, indicating completion. */
  }
}

/*
  Optional: Adding text inside the progress bar for percentage display
  This part is more advanced and might involve JavaScript to update the text.
  For pure CSS, you could use ::before or ::after pseudo-elements,
  but it's often simpler with JS.
*/
.progress-bar-text {
  position: absolute; /* Position the text relative to its closest positioned ancestor (the container) */
  top: 50%; /* Vertically center the text */
  left: 50%; /* Horizontally center the text */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* Fine-tune centering */
  color: white; /* Text color */
  font-weight: bold;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Add a slight shadow for readability */
  z-index: 10; /* Ensure text is above the progress bar */
}

/*
  Example Usage:

  To use this progress bar, you would create the following HTML structure:

  <div class="progress-bar-container">
    <div class="progress-bar"></div>
    <span class="progress-bar-text">0%</span> <!- This span would typically be updated by JavaScript ->
  </div>

  Make sure to link your CSS file to your HTML document.
  The animation will start automatically when the element is rendered on the page.
  For dynamic updates (e.g., loading data in chunks), you would use JavaScript
  to adjust the `width` property of the `.progress-bar` element directly,
  or trigger different animations. This CSS example focuses on a single,
  pre-defined animation completion.
